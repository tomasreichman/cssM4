            <p>"Parasite," directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a masterfully crafted film that explores the stark divide between social classes in modern South Korea. The film follows the Kim family, who live in a semi-basement apartment and struggle to make ends meet. Their fortunes change when they begin working for the wealthy Park family, leading to a series of events that blend dark comedy with intense drama. The film's narrative is cleverly constructed, revealing layers of complexity as it progresses, and drawing the audience into a gripping story about survival, ambition, and the desire for a better life.</p>

            <p>The film's cinematography and set design are significant aspects of its storytelling. Bong Joon-ho uses the physical spaces of the Kim and Park families’ homes to symbolize their respective social standings. The Kims’ cramped, dimly-lit basement apartment sharply contrasts with the Parks’ spacious, bright, and modern house, which sits high above the city. This visual dichotomy emphasizes the vast socio-economic gap between the two families. The use of vertical space throughout the film, such as the scenes involving staircases and high windows, further reinforces this theme of inequality.</p>

            <p>"Parasite" is also notable for its genre-blending narrative. The film starts as a satirical social commentary, using humor to critique class disparities. However, as the plot unfolds, it shifts into thriller territory, building tension with unexpected twists and shocking revelations. This fluid movement between genres keeps the audience on edge, never quite sure of what will happen next. The film’s unpredictability is one of its greatest strengths, ensuring that it remains engaging and thought-provoking throughout.</p>
